# Using the Decision Tree
In order to use this decision tree, then you need to pass an error function and give it a depth. The depth has to either anything below the size of the attributes. The error functions are located in the utils folder in error_functions.py. The choices in error functions are gini_index, entropy, and majority error. In order to construct the tree, one must pass in the examples, S, the attributes of the data, the labels, and weights if needed. To test the newly constructed tree, you must call test with the test examples, S. After, to get the test error, pass in the newly predicted labels into test_error with the test labels.
