# Using the SVM
In order to use the Dual or Primal SVMs you must first create an instance of the class. For both classes you can just give it a C parameter, an lr and for Dual SVM you can also give it a kernel function.

# Training
In order to train either of the models, you must call the train_dataset function and pass the dataset you'd like to train the SVM on.

# Testing
In order to test the SVMs, you must call the test_dataset function and pass the dataset you'd like to test your newly trained model on.
